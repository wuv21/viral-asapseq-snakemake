# viral-asapseq-snakemake
Upstream processing for single cell ASAPseq for viral vector detection. This pipeline is based on a previous pipeline that was designed for processing of sequencing techniques with antibody derived tags (see [scc-proc](github.com/betts-lab/scc-proc))

## Necessary files
### 1) `config.yaml` file
Example configuration is shown below.

- If ATAC mode is enabled, the sample name MUST match with the sample name used to the demultiplex the fastq files during cellranger-atac mkfastq.
- Multiple samples can be added to the config assuming they follow the same antibody mixture and bead setup.
- All fastq files must be in the fastq_dir path
  - Specific filenames are provided in the `samples` attribute of the yaml file that correspond to the ADT files
  - Order of fastq files in the `samples` attribute corresponds to the `cbc`, `umi`, `tag` numbering system (refer to kallisto documentation).
- In the general settings:
  - `run_modes` section will toggle different modalities to be run.
  - `threads` and `memory` allow rule-specific thread/memory setting respectively. This pipeline is designed for LSF based submission but the lsf.yml file can be edited as needed (see below)

```

### 2) `lsf.yaml`
This file allows for specific LSF submission settings based on rules.
```
__default__:
  - "-q normal"


cellranger_count:
  - "-q denovo"

namesort:
  - "-q denovo"
```

### 3) fastq files for ADT; directory of fastq files for ATAC
Refer to config above

### 4) Antibody catalog csv file (required if doing ADT portion)
Comma separted file with barcodes and descriptions. Example below:

```
CD40,CTCAGATGGAGTATG
CD44,AATCCTTCCGAATGT
CD48,CTACGACGTAGAAGA
CD21,AACCTAGTAGTTCGG
```

### 4) Allowlist cell barcode file (required if doing ADT portion)
Allowlist file containing accepted cell barcodes. One per line. Example below:

```
GTCTGCTATGTCTA
GATGATGCATAGAA
```

## Setup
1. Create conda env and set up LSF job submission for Snakemake (follow instructions [here](https://github.com/Snakemake-Profiles/lsf)).
```
conda create --name <env> --file env.yml
```

2. Run Snakemake
```
bsub -e snek.e -o snek.o snakemake --configfile=config.yaml --profile=lsf -s <path-to-Snakefile>
```

The overall process will look like this (to be added):

3. Downstream analysis of your own choosing. Output files are as follows (to be added)...
